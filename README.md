This is a internet speed app

The project is about checking the interet speed in the local
i have placed the both code (yml) it will push the image to docker hub no CD here
aswell as to GCP Artifact registry from there GKE will take care of the CD

complete END TO END project for the devops

Step 1: Navigate to Google Container Registry
Go to the Google Cloud Console: Open your web browser and navigate to the Google Cloud Console.

Select Your Project: Ensure you have the correct project selected. You can switch projects by clicking on the project name at the top of the screen and selecting the appropriate project from the list.

Access Container Registry:

Use the navigation menu (three horizontal lines in the top left corner) and go to Container Registry under the Storage section. Alternatively, you can directly visit the Container Registry page via this link.
Step 2: View the Repository
Select the Location: If you have images in multiple locations, you might need to select the appropriate location (e.g., us, eu, asia) from the dropdown.

Browse Repositories: You should see a list of repositories within the selected location. The repositories are named based on the paths you used when pushing images, e.g., gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY_NAME.

View Images: Click on the repository name (e.g., speedtest). You will see a list of tags and digests for the images pushed to that repository. You can click on each tag to view more details about the specific image, including metadata and history.

Step 3: Verify Image Details
Image Tags: The list will show the tags you’ve used, such as latest. You can click on these tags to view details like the image’s digest, creation time, and size.

Digest and Metadata: Clicking on a specific tag will show detailed information about the image, such as the digest, media type, and the command used to build the image.

Example
Assuming your image was pushed with the tag latest to the repository gcr.io/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/speedtest, you would look for:

Repository: speedtest
Tag: latest
Troubleshooting
If you don’t see your image:

Ensure the correct project is selected.
Confirm that the image was pushed to the correct location (e.g., us, eu, asia).
Check the GitHub Actions workflow logs to ensure the image push step completed successfully.

steps for gke cluster creation and deploy image


Step 1: Set Up Your GKE Cluster
Create a GKE Cluster:
Go to the GKE page in the Google Cloud Console.
Click "Create cluster".
Configure the cluster as needed (e.g., name, location, node configuration).
Click "Create" to create your GKE cluster.
Step 2: Prepare Kubernetes Deployment YAML File
Create a Kubernetes deployment YAML file (e.g., k8s-deployment.yaml) in your repository. This file defines how your application should be deployed to GKE.

Example k8s-deployment.yaml:

Step 3: Set Up IAM Permissions
Ensure your service account has the necessary permissions to deploy to GKE.

Navigate to the IAM & Admin Page:

Go to the IAM & Admin page in the Google Cloud Console.
Assign Roles to the Service Account:

Find your service account used for GitHub Actions.
Assign the following roles:
Kubernetes Engine Admin
Kubernetes Engine Developer
Step 4: Create GitHub Secrets
Navigate to GitHub Repository Settings:

Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
Add the Following Secrets:

GCP_CREDENTIALS: JSON key file of the GCP service account.
GCP_PROJECT_ID: Your GCP project ID.
GKE_CLUSTER_NAME: Your GKE cluster name.
GKE_CLUSTER_ZONE: The zone of your GKE cluster (e.g., us-central1-a).
Step 5: Update GitHub Actions Workflow
Update your GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/main.yml) to include steps for deploying to GKE.

Here is an example workflow file:

Add the Following Secrets:

GCP_CREDENTIALS: JSON key file of the GCP service account.
GCP_PROJECT_ID: Your GCP project ID.
GKE_CLUSTER_NAME: Your GKE cluster name.
GKE_CLUSTER_ZONE: The zone of your GKE cluster (e.g., us-central1-a).
